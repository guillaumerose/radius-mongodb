MongoDB module for FreeRADIUS (lastest version)
This is just a simple hack in order to use MongoDB as user database (instead of LDAP).
Currently just set Cleartext-password (as rlm_files does).

* Copy rlm_mongo into src/modules/
* Add "rlm_mongo" in src/modules/stable
* Build as usual
	* ./configure
	* make
	* make install
* Edit your configuration 
	* Create a file named mongo in raddb/modules/ and insert this :
	
mongo {

}
	
	* Add in your site configuration in authorize sub-section "mongo"
* Run radiusd

Note :
If you use rlm_mongo in inner-tunnel and mac filter, ensure you have this in eap.conf
copy_request_to_tunnel = yes

Debug :
Requests can be show in mongodb web interface

Todo :
Escape strings
